**Semantic Segmentation on FCCNs : Fully Complex-valued Convolutional Networks using iHSV Color Model.**

In the realm of data representation, complex numbers offer a unique advantage by encapsulating both magnitude and phase information, while maintaining algebraic
rigor through complex analysis. Leveraging these properties, we aim to develop Fully
Complex-valued Convolutional Networks (FCCNs), which are particularly advantageous in fields such as Image Processing and Signal Processing where phase preservation
is crucial. Despite the existence of complex neural networks, there is a significant gap
in research, especially in the area of Semantic Segmentation. Our research proposes
an innovative FCCN model designed specifically for semantic segmentation tasks. The
approach begins by complexifying the input image through the iHSV methodology,
which decomposes the image into its real and imaginary components. Subsequently,
the FCCN model employs complex-valued weights and biases to train these components,
using appropriate encoder and decoder. Our objective is to perform semantic segmentation with the FCCN model and evaluate its performance against the real-valued models.
